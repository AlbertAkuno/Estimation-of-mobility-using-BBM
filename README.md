# Estimation-of-mobility-using-BBM
This repository contains codes and files for estimating mobility residence times of the city of Hermosillo, Mexico, using Brownian bridge model (BBM). The codes were used in the article https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.09963, and Chapter 4 of my PhD thesis, titled "**_Inference on Dterministic and Stochastic Epidemic Models with Mobility_**"
